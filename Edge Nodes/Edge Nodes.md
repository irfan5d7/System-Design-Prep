# Load Balancer/ Api Gateway/ Reverse Proxy

## Load Balancer

A load balancer is a device or software that distributes incoming network traffic across multiple servers to optimize resource utilization, maximize throughput, minimize response time, and avoid overload on any single server. Load balancers can be hardware-based or software-based and are commonly used in high-traffic websites and applications to ensure scalability, availability, and reliability.

## API Gateway

An API gateway is a server that acts as an intermediary between clients (such as web or mobile applications) and backend services (such as databases or microservices). It is responsible for managing and enforcing access control, security, rate limiting, authentication, request/response transformation, and other policies for API (Application Programming Interface) calls. API gateways simplify the process of exposing APIs to external clients by providing a unified interface and abstracting away the complexities of the underlying services.

## Reverse Proxy

A reverse proxy is a server that sits between clients and backend servers, forwarding client requests to the appropriate backend server and returning the response to the client. Unlike a forward proxy, which sits between clients and the internet to handle outbound traffic, a reverse proxy handles inbound traffic and acts on behalf of servers. Reverse proxies are often used for load balancing, SSL termination, caching, compression, and security enforcement, making them an essential component of modern web architectures.
